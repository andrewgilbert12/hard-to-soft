Folder containing my work from nand2tetris MOOC/experiments based on the coursework.

The most interesting portions are:
* Project 5 - CPU, computer, and memory chips implemented in a simple HDL. Builds on chips implemented in projects 1 - 3.
* Project 8 - VM bytecode compiler implemented in python.
* Project 11 - Compiler for Java-like language called "Jack," targeting VM implemented in project 8.
* Project 12 - OS and standard library implemented in Jack.
