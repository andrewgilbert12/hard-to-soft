Folder containing my work from nand2tetris MOOC/experiments based on the coursework.

The most interesting portions are:
* Project 5 - CPU, computer, and memory chips implemented in a simple HDL. Uses simpler chips from projects 1 - 3.
* Project 8 - VM bytecode compiler implemented in python.
* Project 11 - Compiler for Java-like language called "Jack," targeting VM from project 8. Implemented in lex, yacc.
* Project 12 - OS and standard library implemented in Jack.

Example Jack code and Java-based CPU and VM emulators can be found in the official course software package:
